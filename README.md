# Arduino smart house
Arduino workshop I conducted for science club Telephoners at AGH, Cracow. The main purpose for the participants of this workshop was to learn more about microcontrolers and different sensors. The goal set for the end of it was to create a simple home automation system.

##Description
The workshop consisted of a series of meetings, focused on interacting with different sensors, such as:
 - BMP180 and BME280 pressure and temperature sensors
 - DS18B20 temperature sensor
 - PIR movement sensor
 - IR reciever
 - RFID reader

By the end of the workshop the group has prepared software for main board and alarm system. The main board could measure temperature, humidity and atmosferic pressure, and drive 8 channels of relays using remote controller and port expander, while the alarm had three zones guarded by PIR sensors and reed switches, and could be armed and disarmed using RFID card.

A modified version of the main board (with different display and auto-brightness control using LDR) servs as weather station in my dorm room.
